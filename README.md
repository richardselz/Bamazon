## User Experience
- <img src="/Bamazon-Purchase.PNG" alt="Purchasing via Bamazon" style="width: 50px;"/>
- Customers can see the Item ID, Product Name, Department Name, Price & Stock Quantity. They can then choose what item to purchase and if the item has sufficient quantity the number of items they purchased is subtracted from available quantity.

- ![Alt text](/Bamazon-Insufficient-Quantity.PNG?raw=true "Insufficient Quantity via Bamazon")
- If a customer chooses to purchase a quantity greater than the available quantity they will be given this error. 
- Once a customer is done purchasing or being notified their quantity is greater than available, it will then ask if they would like to purchase more products. If they click "Yes" they will see the table again and have the ability to buy a new item and quantity. If they click "No" the server connection ends and the session is closed.
